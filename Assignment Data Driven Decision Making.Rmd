## Why was data driven decision making (3DM) useful in this business case?

Coca Cola is one of the most popular brands all over the world. To be able to develop new drinks for customers, Coca Cola decided to set up an experiment all over the world. Data Driven Decision making was applicable to this experiment, as Coca Cola could develop new flavours based on the received data from consumers in different countries all over the world. 

## How did the organization apply 3DM?

In this experiment, Coca Cola has placed vending machines in various countries around the world, where consumers can choose their own flavour, such as Sprite Cherry or Mango Diet Coke. 

After a certain period of time, it became possible for Coca Cola to see trends in consumer behavior per country or even per region. In England, for example, there was a high demand for a cherry-flavoured Sprite drink or a sugar-free Mango flavoured Coca Cola. Coca Cola anticipated this by marketing these flavours in the country and selling them in supermarkets. By doing so, Coca Cola used real data to make a choice for new drinks in its assortment.

## What can the organization do with 3DM that they couldnâ€™t do before?

Coca Cola can now use real and direct data from consumers based in various countries all over the world. They can also implement this experiment in more countries or in specific regions to analyze the difference in consumer behavior and preferences.
